# Higher Level Programming

This repository has projects for higher-level programming. High-level language refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses, and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. Unlike low-level assembly languages, high-level languages have few, if any, language elements that translate directly into a machine's native opcodes. Other features, such as string handling routines, object-oriented language features, and file input/output, may also be present. One thing to note about high-level programming languages is that these languages allow the programmer to be detached and separated from the machine. That is, unlike low-level languages like assembly or machine language, high-level programming can amplify the programmer's instructions and trigger a lot of data movements in the background without their knowledge. The responsibility and power of executing instructions have been handed over to the machine from the programmer.
I covered basic concepts of Python Programming Language(projects listed below). More will follow.

- **Python - Hello, World**
- **Python - if/else, loops, functions**
- **Python - import & modules**
- **Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples**
- **Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary**

These projects were issued and completed as part of the curriculum for ALX SE program at ALX. More information on this amazing program can be found through this [link](https://www.alxafrica.com/).

I also got some very insightful knowledge about higher-level programming from this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) link.
